# Language Specification

This document serves to outline a language specification (and name!) for
the assembly-like language to be used in the project.

The language **must incorporate the concept of "anachronism"** in its
design.

Anachronism --- literally "against + time". Refers to juxtaposition of
incompatible things (time-wise), e.g., 19th century man on a motorcycle.

From meaning:

  - Y2K imagery (e.g. Evangelion)
  
From literal interpretation:

  - Clock moving backwards
  - Architecture of language
